# --- Conditional Edges (Routing Functions) ---

# Currently, the graph in build_graph.py is sequential and uses direct
# workflow.add_edge() calls. Therefore, no conditional edge functions
# are defined here yet.

# If you need to add branching logic (e.g., based on the status,
# error messages, or content analysis), you would define functions here
# that take the RivalryState as input and return the name of the next node
# (or END) as a string.

# Example Placeholder for future conditional logic:
# def decide_next_step(state: RivalryState) -> Literal["call_gemini", "handle_error", "__end__"]:
#     """
#     Example function to decide the next node based on the state.
#     This would be used with workflow.add_conditional_edges() in build_graph.py.
#     """
#     if state.get("status") == "error":
#         print("Routing to error handling (not implemented)")
#         # return "handle_error" # If you add an error handling node
#         return "__end__" # Or just end on error
#     elif state.get("status") == "gemini_done":
#         print("Routing to END")
#         return "__end__"
#     elif state.get("status") == "openai_done":
#          print("Routing to format_gemini_prompt (if using conditional edges)")
#          # This specific route is handled by direct edge in the current build_graph.py
#          # You would change build_graph.py to use add_conditional_edges if needed.
#          return "format_gemini_prompt" # Example if format was conditional
#     else:
#         # Default or other conditions
#         print(f"Unexpected status for routing: {state.get('status')}")
#         return "__end__"

# You would then use this function in build_graph.py like:
# workflow.add_conditional_edges(
#     "some_node",  # The node after which this decision is made
#     decide_next_step,
#     {
#         "call_gemini": "call_gemini",
#         "handle_error": "handle_error_node", # Example error node
#         "__end__": END
#     }
# )
